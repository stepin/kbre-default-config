# KBRE Default Configuration

It's default configuration for [KBRE](https://github.com/stepin/kbre).

It's not expected that it can be used as is. Most probably, customization will be required.
So, it's recommended to create fork, and to checkout it to `~/.kbre` folder.

Presets:

- `cli`: Kotlin Native cli
- `script`: Kotlin Native Scripting
- `spring`: Kotlin + Coroutines + Spring3
